  - Fine calculation is done **day by day** (not continuous).
- **Faculty** do not incur fines but are marked as overdue if they keep a book for more than 60 days.

---

### Data Persistence

- The system saves all data (books, users, borrowing records, etc.) to text files, ensuring that data is retained between program runs.
- Data is loaded automatically when the program starts.

---

## File Structure

The program uses the following files to store data:

1. **books.txt**: Stores book information.
   - Format: `ID|Name|Author|Publisher|ISBN|Available|reserver_id`

2. **students.txt**: Stores student user information.
   - Format: `ID|Username|Password|BorrowedBooksCount`

3. **student_records.txt**: Stores borrowing records for students.
   - Format: `StudentID|BookID|TimeStamp`

4. **student_history.txt**: Stores borrowing history for students.
   - Format: `StudentID|BookID`

5. **faculty.txt**: Stores faculty user information.
   - Format: `ID|Username|Password|BorrowedBooksCount`

6. **faculty_records.txt**: Stores borrowing records for faculty.
   - Format: `FacultyID|BookID|TimeStamp`

7. **faculty_history.txt**: Stores borrowing history for faculty.
   - Format: `FacultyID|BookID`

8. **librarians.txt**: Stores librarian user information.
   - Format: `ID|Username|Password`

9. **user_next_ID.txt**: Stores the next available user ID.
10. **book_next_ID.txt**: Stores the next available book ID.

---

## How to Use

1. **Compilation**:
   - Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed (e.g., `g++`).
   - Compile the program using the following command:
     ```bash
     g++ -o lms lms.cpp
     ```

2. **Execution**:
   - Run the compiled program:
     ```bash
     ./lms
     ```

3. **Default Data**:
   - If no data files are found, the system will automatically load default data (10 books, 5 students, 3 faculty members, and 1 librarian).

4. **Login**:
   - Upon running the program, you will be presented with a home menu where you can log in as a **Student**, **Faculty**, or **Librarian**.
   - Use the default credentials or create new users to log in.

5. **Navigation**:
   - After logging in, follow the on-screen menus to perform various operations such as borrowing, returning, or reserving books.

---

## Assumptions

1. **Input Choices**:
   - All menu choices are assumed to be **integers**. Invalid inputs (e.g., strings or floats) may cause unexpected behavior.

2. **Fine Calculation**:
   - Fines are calculated **day by day** (not continuously). For example, if a book is overdue by 16 days, the fine will be 10 Rupees (for 1 day over the 15-day limit).

3. **File Storage**:
   - All data files are stored in the **same directory** as the executable. If the program is moved, the files will be created in the new directory.

4. **Overdue for Faculty**:
   - Faculty members are marked as overdue if they keep a book for more than 60 days, but no fines are imposed.
5. **Reservation**
   - reserver_id = 0, no reservation has been made, any other number mean that particular user id made the reservation.
6. **Initial Inputs**
   - in case of already ran file the input will be as follows
   - Students : student1-student5 (ID: 1-5) password: password1-password5
   - Faculty  : faculty1-faculty3 (ID: 6-8) password: password1-password3
   - Librarian: librarian1 (ID: 9) password:password1
   - Books : book1-book10 (ID 1-10) similarly,other attributes will add id at the end of it
7. **ID**
   - in this system, i am auto generating id's of the users and books and id would be used as unique representation of an user and a book.
